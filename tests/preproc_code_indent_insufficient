The line is insufficiently indented. Crowbar will not know the source language,
(we can't), so we infer that ' p' is the indentation + possible line-comment
prefix.

In case of more lines, we additionally check that each code line shares the same
prefix of characters from line start to the offset of the block opening marker.
But even this is insufficient if the block e.g. calls `render` multiple times.

The line is insufficiently indented. Crowbar will not know the source language,
(we can't), so indentation is inferred.

In this case, there are multiple lines, so we check that each line's inferred
prefix is the same. In this case, it won't be, so we detect the invalid
indentation and raise an IndentationError

 for x in range(10):
    print("it'll still fail")

The line is insufficiently indented. Crowbar will not know the source language,
(we can't), so we infer that ' p' is the indentation + possible line-comment
prefix.

Because there are multiple code lines, we'll then validate that all share the
same prefix. If code lines are differnt, e.g. by some lines calling render(),
others looping or setting vars, then a second indentation check will catch it.

However, if the lines all share the same prefix, as multiple calls to a function
would, then we still pass the incorrectly inferred code off for evaluation.

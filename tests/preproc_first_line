.. first (and only) line should say "hello"
# <<crowbar
# emit("hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl's at the start of a block should be a NO-OP, the line is already
a "fresh" line.
# <<crowbar
# emit(fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl's are still NO-OPs in this context, same result as before
# <<crowbar
# emit(fl, fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. expect first line to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(nl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. expect two first lines to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(nl, nl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl should be NO-OP, so still expecting two first lines to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(nl, nl, fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

--- now with indentation
.. first (and only) line should say "hello"
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl's at the start of a block should be a NO-OP, the line is already
a "fresh" line.
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl's are still NO-OPs in this context, same result as before
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, fl, fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. expect first line to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, nl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. expect two first lines to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, nl, nl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>

.. fl should be NO-OP, so still expecting two first lines to be empty
# <<crowbar
# emit(indent, nl, nl, fl, "hello")
# >>
# <<end>>
